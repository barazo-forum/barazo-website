## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Do not open a public issue for security vulnerabilities.**

Instead, use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting:

1. Go to the repository
2. Click "Security" tab
3. Click "Report a vulnerability"
4. Fill in the details

Or email: security@barazo.forum (TBD - will be set up in Phase 2)

We will respond within 72 hours with next steps.

## Security Practices

- All commits must be GPG signed
- Dependencies updated weekly via Dependabot
- CI runs security scans on every PR
- OWASP Top 10 compliance verified

## Disclosure Policy

We follow responsible disclosure:
- 90 days before public disclosure
- Credit given to reporter (if desired)
- CVE assigned when applicable
